# Investopedia Login Automation

Investopedia Login Automation is a Python script that uses Selenium and the Edge webdriver to automate the login process for Investopedia. The script reads the username and password from a file named "login_details.txt" and logs in to Investopedia using those credentials. After logging in, it takes a full screenshot of the webpage and saves it as "screenshot.png".
